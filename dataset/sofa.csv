Couch,464961,"A couch (U.S. English, British English), which is not to be confused with sofa, settee (British English), or chesterfield (Canadian English and British English) is a piece of furniture for seating two or three people in the form of a bench, with armrests, that is partially or entirely upholstered, and often fitted with springs and tailored cushions. Although a couch is used primarily for seating, it may be used for sleeping.
In homes, couches are normally found in the family room, living room, den, or the lounge. They are sometimes also found in non-residential settings such as hotels, lobbies of commercial offices, waiting rooms, and bars.
The term couch is predominantly used in Ireland, North America, South Africa and Australia whereas the terms sofa and settee (U and non-U) are generally used in the United Kingdom. The word couch originated in Middle English from the Old French noun couche, which derived from the verb meaning ""to lie down"". It originally denoted an item of furniture for lying or sleeping on, somewhat like a chaise longue, but now refers to sofas in general. The word sofa comes from Turkish and is derived from the Arabic word suffa (""wool""), originating in the Aramaic word sippa (""mat""). The word settee comes from the Old English word, setl, which was used to describe long benches with high backs and arms, but is now generally used to describe upholstered seating.
Other terms which can be synonymous with the above definition are chesterfield (Canada), divan, davenport, lounge, and canapé.

Accubita,5608720,"Accubita was one name for the Ancient Roman furniture couches used in the time of the Roman emperors, in the triclinium or dining room, for reclining upon at meals. It was also apparently sometimes the name of the dining room itself, or a niche for a couch. Sometimes it denotes a multi-person curved couch, for which the term stibadium is also used. Klinai is the Greek equivalent, sometimes also used.
The mattresses and feather-beds were softer and higher, and the supports (fulcra) of them lower in proportion, than in older triclinium couches. The cloths and pillows spread over them, and over beds, were called accubitalia.",91
Chaise longue,1252792,"A chaise longue (English: ; French pronunciation: ​[ʃɛz lɔ̃ɡ], ""long chair"") is an upholstered sofa in the shape of a chair that is long enough to support the legs.
In modern French the term chaise longue can refer to any long reclining chair such as a deckchair. A literal translation in English is ""long chair"". In the United States the term lounge chair is also used to refer to any long reclining chair. In the United States, chaise longue is nearly always written ""chaise lounge"" and pronounced /tʃeɪsˈlaʊndʒ/, the first constituent a spelling pronunciation, the second a 19th-century folk-anagrammatic adaptation of French longue. 
The chaise longue has traditionally been associated with psychoanalysis and many psychoanalysts continue to keep chaises longues in their offices for use in psychotherapy.

Daybed,8069383,"Daybeds are used as beds as well as for lounging, reclining and seating in common rooms. Their frames can be made out of wood, metal or a combination of wood and metal.
They are a cross between chaise longue, couch and a bed.

Divan (furniture),5555424,"A divan (Turkish divan, originally from Persian devan) is a piece of couch-like sitting furniture or, in some countries, a box-spring based bed.
Primarily, in the Middle East (especially the Ottoman Empire), a divan was a long seat formed of a mattress laid against the side of the room, upon the floor or upon a raised structure or frame, with cushions to lean against.
Divans received this name because they were generally found along the walls in Middle Eastern council chambers of a bureau called divan or diwan (from Persian, meaning a government council or office, from the bundles of papers they processed, and next their council chambers).

Divans are a common feature of the liwan, a long, vaulted, narrow room in Levantine homes. The divan in the sense of a sofa or couch entered the English language in 1702 and has been commonly known in Europe since about the middle of the 18th century. It was fashionable, roughly from 1820 to 1850, wherever the romantic movement in literature penetrated. All the boudoirs of that generation were garnished with divans. They spread to coffee-houses, which were sometimes known as divans or Turkish divans, and a cigar divan remains a familiar expression. This is preserved today in Romanian as divan, Bulgarian and Russian as диван (divan).
Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic couch was a divan, draped with a heavy Persian rug and cushions, given to him as a gift from a patient.",21
Fainting couch,22098542,"A fainting couch is a couch with a back that is traditionally raised at one end. The back may be situated completely at one side of the couch, or may wrap around and extend the entire length of the piece much like a traditional couch. However, fainting couches are easily differentiated from more traditional couches, having one end of the back raised.
Fainting couches were popular in the 19th century, and were particularly used by women.
Some houses would take this to the level of having separate fainting rooms, where these couches would be the featured furniture.

Futon,402909,"A futon (布団) is a Japanese traditional bedding.
A bedding set consists of both a mattress (敷き布団, shikibuton, lit. ""spreading futon"") and a duvet (掛け布団, kakebuton, lit. ""covering futon""). Both elements of a futon bedding set are pliable enough to be aired, folded and stored away in an oshiire closet during the day, allowing the room to serve for purposes other than as a bedroom.

Western-style futons, which typically resemble low, wooden sofa beds, differ substantially from their Japanese counterparts. They often have the dimensions of a western mattress, and are too thick to fold 180°. They are often set up and stored on a slatted frame, which avoids having to move them to air them, especially in the dry indoor air of a centrally-heated house (Japanese homes were not traditionally centrally-heated).

Klinai,8460062,"Klinai (couches; singular klinē) also known as lectus triclinaris were a type ancient furniture used by the Ancient Greeks and Ancient Romans in their symposia or convivia. Three klinai were arranged in a 'U' shape, which together formed the triclinium, which was where the dinner guests reclined during the meal.",90
Klippan (sofa),2810508,"The Klippan sofa is a popular model of sofa manufactured and sold by IKEA. Klippan means ""the Cliff"" in Swedish. (IKEA's nomenclature conventions name upholstered furniture after places in Sweden. This sofa is named after Klippan Municipality in Southern Sweden). It was first sold in 1979 and celebrated its 30th birthday in 2009 and continues to be one of IKEA's most popular and longstanding products. It comes in a standard two-seat size (which fits easily through standard house doorways), and can be fitted with a range of removable and interchangeable fabric covers. As well as standard cotton covers, IKEA sells 'exclusive' collections of covers, retiring designs after a year.

There have been several functional changes to the Klippan in the past 30 years. The initial model featured a solid wood frame. This has been replaced in contemporary models by a less expensive, lightweight frame of combined particleboard, fiberboard and polyurethane foam. Likewise, while earlier models stood on painted wood legs, contemporary Klippan legs are made from steel or aluminum. In 2004, the sofa was reconstructed so that it could be easily flatpacked and put together at home. Adjustments to the materials used in the sofa and the centralization of production methods allowed IKEA to reduce the price of the Klippan sofa by 40% since 1979.
In 2003, the Klippan was used as the standard sofa in a test to compare the British fire safety requirements against the Swedish and mainland European safety requirements. Three Klippans were used, one with no flame retardant treatment, one treated with phosphorus-based flame retardant, and one treated with bromine-based flame retardant. All three sofas were specially manufactured by IKEA in its workshops at Älmhult.
In 2005, a large orange Klippan was installed in Frogmoor township to celebrate the opening of a nearby IKEA store. The Klippan was one of two IKEA items to be replicated at five times the actual size.

Knole Settee,494018,"The Knole settee (sometimes known as the Knole Sofa) was made in the 17th century. It is housed at Knole in Kent, a house owned by the Sackville-Wests since 1605 but now in the care of the National Trust. It was originally used not as comfortable sofa but as a formal throne on which the monarch would have sat to receive visitors. It features adjustable side arms and considerable depth of seating, it usually has exposed wooden finials at the rear corner tops, and some exposed wood may be present on the otherwise arms. The arms, more correctly sides, are of the same height. The side arms are tied to the sofa back by means of heavy decorative braid, often with an elaborate tassel.

Ottoman (furniture),994402,"An ottoman is a form of couch which usually has a head but no back, though sometimes it has neither. It may have square or semicircular ends, and as a rule it is what upholsterers call “stuffed over” — that is to say no wood is visible.
In American English, an ottoman is a piece of furniture consisting of a padded, upholstered seat or bench, usually having neither a back nor arms, often used as a stool, footstool or, in some cases, as a coffee table. Ottomans are often sold as coordinating furniture with armchairs or gliders. An ottoman can also be known as a footstool, tuffet, hassock, ""Sitee"" or pouffe. In British English, ""ottoman"" also denotes an upholstered seat without a back or arms, but one that usually serves as storage, with the seat hinged to form a lid.
Ottomans can be used in many rooms; they can be used in the bedroom, gaming room, family room and guest room. Leather and bench ottomans are used as alternatives to sofas.

Triclinium,2379182,"A triclinium (plural: triclinia) is a formal dining room in a Roman building. The word is adopted from the Greek τρικλίνιον, triklinion, from τρι-, tri-, ""three"", and κλίνη, klinē, a sort of ""couch"" or rather chaise longue. Each couch was wide enough to accommodate three diners who reclined on their left side on cushions while some household slaves served multiple courses rushed out of the culina, or kitchen, and others entertained guests with music, song, or dance.
The triclinium was characterized by three klinai on three sides of a low square table, whose surfaces sloped away from the table at about 10 degrees. Diners would recline on these surfaces in a semi-recumbent position. The fourth side of the table was left free, presumably to allow service to the table. Usually the open side faced the entrance of the room. In Roman-era dwellings, particularly wealthy ones, triclinia were common  and the hosts and guest would recline on pillows while feasting.
The Museum of Archeology in Arezzo, Italy, or the House of Caro in Pompeii offer what are thought to be accurate reconstructions of triclinia. The custom of using klinai while taking a meal rather than sitting became popular among the Greeks in the early seventh century BC. From here it spread to their colonies in southern Italy (Magna Graecia) and was eventually adopted by the Etruscans.
In contrast to the Greek tradition of allowing only male guests into the formal dining room, called andrōn, while everyday meals were taken with the rest of the family in the oikos, the Etruscans seem to not have restricted the use of the klinē to the male gender. The Romans may have seen the first dining klinai as used by the Etruscans but may have refined the practice when they later came to closer contact with the Greek culture.

Dining was the defining ritual in Roman domestic life, lasting from late afternoon through late at night. Typically, 9-20 guests were invited, arranged in a prescribed seating order to emphasize divisions in status and relative closeness to the dominus. As static, privileged space, dining rooms received extremely elaborate decoration, with complex perspective scenes and central paintings (or, here, mosaics). Dionysus, Venus, and still lifes of food were popular, for obvious reasons. Middle class and elite Roman houses usually had at least two triclinia; it's not unusual to find four or more. Here, the triclinium maius (big dining room) would be used for larger dinner parties, which would typically include many clients of the owner.
Smaller triclinia would be used for smaller dinner parties, with a more exclusive set of guests. Hence their decoration was often at least as elaborate as that found in larger triclinia. As in the larger triclinia, wine, food, and love were always popular themes. However, because of their association with patronage and because dining entertainment often including recitation of high-brow literature like epics, dining rooms could also feature more ""serious"" themes. As in many houses in Pompeii, here the smaller dining room (triclinium minus) forms a suite with the adjoining cubiculum and bath.

Window seat (type of sofa),2279802,"A window seat is a miniature sofa without a back, intended to fill the recess of a window. In the latter part of the 18th century, when tall narrow sash windows were almost universal, the window seat was in high favor, and was no doubt in keeping with the formalism of Georgian interiors. It differed much in decorative detail, but little in form. It stood as high from the floor as a chair; the two ends were identical, with a roll-over curve, more or less pronounced. The seats and ends were usually upholstered in rich fabrics which in many cases have remained intact. The legs followed the fashion in chairs and were square and tapered, or, somewhat later, round and reeded. Hepplewhite and the brothers Adam designed many graceful window seats, but they were produced by all the cabinet-makers of the period.",81
